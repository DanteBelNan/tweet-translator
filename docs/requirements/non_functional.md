# Non-Functional Requirements

This document describes the non-functional requirements for the "Tweet Translator" application, focusing on quality attributes.

### NFR1. Security

* **Secure Credential Storage:** API credentials (Twitter, OpenAI) shall be stored securely (e.g., environment variables) and shall not be hardcoded in the source.
* **Secure Communication:** Communication with Twitter and OpenAI APIs shall occur over secure connections (HTTPS).

### NFR2. Reliability

* **Retry Mechanism:** The system shall be capable of retrying failed operations (e.g., temporary network outages, API errors).
* **Logging:** The system shall have a robust logging mechanism to audit activity, errors, and important events.

### NFR3. Performance

* **Timely Processing:** The system shall be able to process and translate tweets within a reasonable time to avoid significant delays between original publication and translation.
* **Resource Efficiency:** Resource consumption (CPU, memory) shall be efficient, especially during continuous operation.

### NFR4. Scalability

* **Extensibility:** The architecture shall allow for future extension to handle multiple source/destination account pairs or multiple target languages.

### NFR5. Maintainability

* **Modular Codebase:** The source code shall be modular, readable, and well-documented to facilitate future modifications and maintenance.
* **Coding Standards:** The project shall adhere to Python best coding practices.
